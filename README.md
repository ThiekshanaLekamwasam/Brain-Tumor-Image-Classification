# Brain-Tumor-Image-Classification

Brain tumours are among the most fatal and devastating diseases, often resulting in a significant reduction in life expectancy. 
For this reason, an accurate and rapid diagnosis is crucial to develop treatment plans that can prolong the lives of those affected. Hence the need for a reliable deep learning (DL) model to accurately diagnose the presence and type of brain tumours. 
In this study, a Deep Learning approach based on transfer learning is proposed to effectively classify brain tumours. More specifically:
1. Data Exploration
2. CT_Classification
3. CT_Multi_Predictions

The reconstruction of the transfer learning architecture and fine-tuning (Model Selection)
The transfer learning algorithms that will be used will be:
- Xception
- ResNet101V2
- VGG16
